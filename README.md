# XR_BeatCoins_Unity

Languages & Framework: C#, Oculus Integration SDK, and Unity. 

1. Designed a game where the goal is to destroy the coins coming your way as you are listening to a high-beat song played in the background.
2. The core mechanic of the game is to punch and destroy the coins (the shapes). User uses the controllers to punch the shapes, once punched the shape breaks into smaller pieces. 
3. A successful punch will lead to a score increment based on the destroyed coins score value. An unsuccessful punch  when punched with the wrong hand will lead to a score decrement. 
4. The game includes a main scene includes a background sound clip and presents three buttons corresponding to the levels of your game representing the 3 levels in the game. 
5. The game will also spawn blocks that players must avoid in the form of doors. If they are hit by the blocks, they will lose points. 
6. The player starts with a score of 0 points. The goal is to get as many points as possible by punching the coins with correct controllers, while ensuring the score never goes below 0. 
7. If the score goes below zero after level start, the player loses the level, and the end-of-level menu appears otherwise the user can move to the next level.
